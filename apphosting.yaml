# Firebase App Hosting configuration for a Next.js app
# This is a minimal configuration.
# Refer to Firebase documentation for more options:
# https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting/configure-serve

# Specifies the build and run settings.
# Firebase App Hosting automatically detects Next.js and uses appropriate build commands.
# You can customize build environment variables if needed.
# For example, to set NODE_ENV to production (often default for builds):
# env:
#   - variable: NODE_ENV
#     value: production
#
# If your application requires other environment variables (e.g., API keys for Genkit),
# you should configure them as secrets in Firebase Secret Manager and reference them here:
# env:
#   - variable: GOOGLE_API_KEY # The variable name your app expects
#     secret: NAME_OF_YOUR_SECRET_IN_SECRET_MANAGER # The secret you created in Firebase

# Server runtime configuration
runConfig:
  # Minimum number of server instances. Set to 0 for cost optimization during inactivity.
  # For a production app, you might want to set this to 1 or higher based on expected traffic.
  minInstances: 0
  # You can specify CPU, memory, and concurrency if needed.
  # cpu: 1
  # memoryMiB: 512
  # concurrency: 80

# Backend settings are typically automatically configured for Next.js by App Hosting.
# backend: {}
